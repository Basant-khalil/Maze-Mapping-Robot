# Microcontroller-Based Maze Navigation Robot
Website: https://basant-khalil.github.io/Maze-Mapping-Robot/

This repository contains the code, circuit designs, and documentation for a microcontroller-based robot designed to navigate a maze, detect paths, walls, and treasures. The primary objectives of this project are:

* Algorithm Design: Develop an efficient algorithm to enable the robot to navigate through the maze, identifying paths, walls, and treasures. The algorithm will utilize a dim near infrared LED blinking at approximately 25 kHz for detection.

* Physical System: Build the physical system, including the robot chassis, sensors, and actuators, to facilitate communication of information to a base station. The base station will graphically display the progress of the robot.

* Circuitry Design: Design the circuitry to display the location of discovered treasures on a monitor. Additionally, implement control over the LEDs on the robot, allowing for precise on/off functionality with customizable colors.
