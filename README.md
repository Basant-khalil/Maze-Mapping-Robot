Website: https://basant-khalil.github.io/Maze-Mapping-Robot/

This repository contains the code, circuit designs, and documentation for a microcontroller-based robot designed to navigate complex mazes, accurately detect paths, walls, and hidden treasures. The primary objectives of this project are:

* Algorithm Design: The primary objective is to devise a highly efficient and intelligent algorithm that empowers the robot to autonomously navigate intricate mazes. This algorithm will not only enable the robot to identify and differentiate paths from walls but also utilize a dim near infrared LED blinking at a frequency of approximately 25 kHz for precise detection of hidden treasures. By utilizing advanced pathfinding techniques and treasure localization algorithms, the robot will be able to map the maze with huge accuracy.

* Physical System: The physical system includes a precisely crafted robot structure equipped with advanced sensors and actuators. These components will enable the robot to interact with its environment, accurately measure distances, detect obstacles, and make informed navigation decisions. By incorporating robust mechanics and carefully chosen materials, the physical system will provide a solid foundation for reliable maze exploration.

* Circuitry Design: An integral part of the project is the design of sophisticated circuitry that not only displays the location of discovered treasures but also enables precise control over the robot's LEDs with customizable colors. The circuitry will include innovative designs for monitoring and displaying treasure locations on a dedicated monitor. Additionally, it will provide precise control over the robot's LEDs, allowing for seamless on/off functionality and the ability to create captivating light patterns. This circuitry will enhance the overall user experience and showcase the robot's capabilities in a visually appealing manner.
